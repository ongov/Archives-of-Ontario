Creative Impact Supercourse 

In CRI 815, students start with a problem that has been identified by a real client (e.g. a company, community organization, or external institution) and develop a conceptual solution and improve it through testing and feedback. 
Students are supported by faculty and project mentors, and are encouraged to push the boundaries of creativity in search of innovative solutions. In the process, students gain valuable hands-on experience in collaborative, design-based teamwork, while working with a real life "client".
