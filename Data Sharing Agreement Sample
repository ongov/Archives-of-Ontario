[Insert Organization 1 – Educational Program]
	
AND

[Insert Organization 2 – Data Owners]

(collectively, the “Parties”)

1.	DEFINITIONS

1.1 In this Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”): 

“Access” means accessing by Users during the term of the graduate program

“Data” means the data contained in the Data Set

“Data Destruction Software” means software that is capable of destroying data in tapes, hard disks and other forms of electronic media so that it is completely unreadable. 

“Data Set” means a collection of related sets of information gathered by the Information, Privacy and Archives Division (“IPA”). The table below outlines the Data Set collection being used as part of this pilot, the sensitivity of the Data Set and its legal rights:

Data Set	Sensitivity	Licence / Copyright

		

“FIPPA” means the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31, as amended or replaced from time to time.

“Low Sensitivity” means data that is unrestricted, does not contain personal information and is currently unavailable publicly. 

“Users” means any individual who, as part of the [Insert Organization 1], uses the Data Set to participate in or teach the graduate program.

“Personal Information” has the same meaning as in FIPPA.

2.	BACKGROUND

2.1 Through this MOU, the [Insert Organization 2] will allow [Insert Organization 1] to use the Data Set for the purpose of administering a course (“pilot project”). The course will provide students an opportunity to support real world business decision-making with real business data. Students will blend theoretical knowledge with hands-on practical skills for data collection, analysis, and manipulation.
 
[Insert Organization 1] prepares students for a career in the high-demand area of Data Analytics, teaching students the knowledge and skills they need to support real-world business decision-making and planning through data insights, data management and data science.  

Experts in the field consistently report that about 80% of the work involved in data and analytics is focused on the cleaning and preparation of data sets for analysis.  Excellent data management and remediation practices are necessary to gain an appreciation for the insights that data can provide.  

The Ontario government maintains massive data sets. Effective use of data sets can help identify social and economic needs to improve service delivery to Ontarians. The Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner is actively encouraging the OPS to step carefully and thoughtfully into the world of big data.  Ensuring an active appreciation for emerging data management and remediation practices will be helpful in this regard. 

This pilot project will enable the [Insert Organization 2] to consider new approaches to managing large data set structures and discover new points of access to this data in order to manage and preserve the public record of the Government of Ontario. As such, this pilot project is consistent with the purposes of the Archives and Recordkeeping Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c. 34, Sched. A. 

3.	PURPOSE & SCOPE

3.1	The purpose of this MOU is to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Parties related to the pilot project with respect to the use, security, and confidentiality of the Data Sets. 

3.2	The objective of this pilot project is to deliver immediate value to students in the [Insert Organization 1], and to test the potential for a broader partnership to enhance the experiential learning component of post-secondary data science and analytics programs in Ontario and improve awareness and adoption into the OPS of leading practices in data management.
 
3.3 The pilot project will enable the Parties to expand their learning in data analytics, assess best practices, draw conclusions and determine opportunities for next steps. The opportunities for shared learning through collaboration will benefit both Parties.

3.4	The [Insert Organization 2] Data is being shared with the [Insert Organization 1] for research and scholarly purposes and the [Insert Organization 2] anticipates the secure and respectful management of IPA’s data while in [Insert Organization 1] custody.

4.	ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
